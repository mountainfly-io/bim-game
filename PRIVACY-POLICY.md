# Privacy Policy

Thank you for playing Bim game!

This is the privacy policy for Bim software (“App”), developed by Mountainfly Oy, describing how we collect, use and handle your information, and what choices you have.

This App does not have specific target age group, but is designed to be enjoyed by both children and adults alike. The content is appropriate for children as it avoids adult themes like violence, sexual or sexual content, swearing and other profanities, and so on.

This App gathers no personal or otherwise sensitive data from you. Any preferences or other cached data are only stored locally and never shared outside the device (for example a mobile phone or a tablet). The preferences include sound on/off setting and whether the in-game tutorials and hints are enabled or not, which the user can control in the app settings. Some preferences are implicit, for example the App stores the previously open game mode for the user’s convenience.

This App uses following device hardware features

Some play modes like Spaceship and Bubbles read the device physical orientation information from the device sensors, used to rotate the game content in the actual device orientation, but none of that information is persistently stored or shared outside the device.
Gadget mode includes a simple recorder that uses the device microphone to record short sound clips and play them back to the user through the device’s audio output. The recordings are only stored temporarily in the app’s local cache, only one clip at a time, only used in the way described here, and never shared outside the device by this App. The cached recording is deleted when the app is closed.
